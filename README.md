# WebViewToo
Allows for use of the WebView2 Framework within AHK to create Web-based GUIs

The latest version of this Repo requires AutoHotkey v2.1-alpha.1
Several major changes were made to this repo, current scripts may break
when updating to the newer version.  The biggest change is the class name
and `QueryPage()` methods.

If you have any issues getting an existing script to work with this new update,
please reach out to me.
